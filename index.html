        <p> I am an international student majoring in computer science. I am a junior, and I am planning to minor in
          cybersecurity next semester. In my free time, I watch YouTube and TV Shows. I also programmed an Android app
          that alerts me whenever there is an empty spot in one of the classes that I want to add. Using the app, I was
          able to add this course, even though it was full most of the time.</p>
